# hashish

> ðŸš¬ A fork of `hashbrown` with a chill name. Same fast hash maps, open to experiments.

`hashish` is a high-performance hash map and hash set implementation in Rust, based on the amazing work done in [`hashbrown`](https://github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown). Itâ€™s fast, flexible, and battle-tested â€” just with a slightly more *relaxed* name.

Think of it as the same hash table core that powers Rustâ€™s standard `HashMap`, but now with room to tinker, explore new ideas, or just enjoy the vibes.
